Qumu is a video streaming platform for professionals.

As a frontend team lead, leading a team of 5, my main tasks are planning projects and managing the team.

Working closely with the product managers, my main mission is to turn functional specifications into a workable project for the team.

I also convinced management of the importance of web accessibility and we are making efforts towards that.

I created a culture of knowledge sharing via various ways (videos, Confluence articles, documentation, pair coding, pair review for pull requests, ...).

I am present at every step of a project:
- Functional specifications
- Technical specifications
- Design & prototypes
- Coding
- QA
- Deployment to production
- Support

Skills used:
- Project management (understanding functional specifications and turning them into technical specifications for the team)
- Team management (regular 1:1, career updates, skillset evaluation)
- JavaScript (VueJS)
- HTML/CSS/SCSS
- Karma/Sinon/Chai/Jest
- Figma

Domains mastered:
- HLS and video streaming
- accessibility
- big data with analytics
