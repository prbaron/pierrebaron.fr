Qumu is a video streaming platform for professionals.

As a senior frontend developer, I participated to the addition of new features to the platform from the functional specifications to the deployment.

My main project was the creation of a new analytics dashboard allowing customers to understand how viewers are consuming the videos.

I am present at every step of a project:
- Functional specifications
- Technical specifications
- Design & prototypes
- Coding
- QA
- Deployment to production
- Support

The company also decided to put a focus on accessibility in order to provide a web player accessible to everybody.

Skills used:
- Project management (understanding functional specifications and turning them into technical specifications for the team)
- JavaScript (VueJS, AngularJS)
- HTML/CSS/SCSS
- Figma
- Karma/Sinon/Chai/Jest
- web accessibility

Domains mastered:
