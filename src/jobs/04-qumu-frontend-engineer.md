Qumu is a video streaming platform for professionals.

As a frontend developer, I participated to the addition of new features to the platform. My mission consisted in turning technical specifications into workable code.

My main project was the overhaul of our HLS video player. We decided to use VueJS. The new player ended up offering more features while being half as big as the previous one.

Skills used:
- JavaScript (AngularJS, VueJS)
- HTML/CSS/SCSS
- Karma/Sinon/Chai
- Sketch

Domains mastered:
- HLS and video streaming
